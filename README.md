# AIModel
This is my repo where I experiment with building AI models and keep track of the evolution

## 1 Pytorch
Pytorch is the main tool for building AI projects BECOUSE:
 -  It provides the ability to use TENSORS ( multidimensional arrays ) just like numpy but with the superpower that they can run on the GPUs computaional power also (Pretty nice considering the new RTXs on the market) 
 - It uses Dynamic Computational Graphs, this means the graph is built on Runtime, this makes it more intuitive and allows easier debugging
 - The Autograd Module, a powerful AUTOMATIC DIFFERENTIATION tool, built in pyTorch, essential for training neural networks, as it simplifies the implementation of back propagation
 - It has its own NEURAL NETWORK MODULE, `torch.nn` provides a simple way to build neural networks
 - It has GREAT DOCUMENTATION, lots of tutorials and even PRE-TRAINED models

Even though I had python installed for other projects, it is a good practice to Create a anaconda environment and install python within it, with all ne dependencies, anaconda takes care automatically of version mismatches and generally make life easier for the developer
